Implementing design patterns in C# keeps code clean, concise, and easy to maintain. Using design patterns establishes consistency that helps developers build and modify code safely and avoid common architecting problems. Being able to recognize design patterns expedites the process of understanding an existing system. Using design patterns improves code readability and testability, while making it more extensible.

In this course, developer and technologist Reynald Adolphe explains the purpose and effective use of eight design patterns, including six Gang of Four design patterns and two .Net patterns. Gang of Four patterns fall under three categories: structural, creational, and behavioral. Reynald helps you learn about select patterns from each category. He describes each pattern and demonstrates how programmers can leverage them in real-world applications.

Topics include:
Factory Method
Abstract Factory
Singleton pattern
Decorator pattern
Iterator pattern
Observer pattern
Repository pattern
Unit of Work pattern
